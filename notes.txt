Vunl: Can bruteforce session ID'S eaisly because of how predictable it is (only 5 nums long)
doesn't assign session_id cookie to the IP, no captchas or IP monitioring. Allows an attacker
to bypass the amount of attempts, possibly to over 10,000,000 attempts.

Fixes: Only gen a session_id cookie when an IP connects, not genrically. Add captchas,
add delays in recieving login attempts.

Code: Expliots bruteforcing valid session_id cookies to bypass lockouts and bruteforce 
account login attempts
